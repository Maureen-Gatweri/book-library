# Setup Instructions
- Clone the repository: Begin by cloning the repository to your local machine. This can be done by copying the repositoryâ€™s URL from GitHub and using it to clone the project into your preferred directory.

- Install dependencies: The application relies on several Ruby gems and dependencies. After cloning the repository, you will need to install these dependencies. You can do this by running the appropriate commands --in your terminal. Ensure that Ruby and Rails are installed on your system before proceeding.

- Set up the database: The application requires a database to store book and borrowing information. You will need to create the database and run migrations, which will set up the necessary tables and fields.

- Start the Rails server: Once the dependencies are installed and the database is set up, you can start the Rails server. This will allow you to view and interact with the application in your browser. By default, the application will be accessible on http://localhost:3000. 

# Testing
## The application includes basic tests to ensure that the models and controllers are functioning as expected.
- Run the tests: The tests cover various aspects of the application, including ensuring that the data is correctly managed and that the views display the necessary information. Running the tests will check for any potential issues in your application.

- You can run the tests using the Rails testing framework. This will run all the tests that are defined for the application, including unit tests for the models and functional tests for the controllers.
